# GoalForge - Web Application
# Locally Hosted Task Management Website
GoalForge is a task management website that was developed with a focus in giving users the ability to better manage their goals, agendas, or any to-dos that users need to complete. The systemâ€™s key functionalities include user registration and authentication, task creation and organization, notification and reminder services, integration of external APIs, etc. The website is not hosted online but runs locally and is connected to a locally hosted database using MySQL. The website has a dashboard displaying the status of tasks that need to be done, has a calendar system that let's users choose their due date of tasks, and a notification system that allows for users to be notified of upcoming tasks. Users can reset their password, change their emails, and change their display name. The task management web application aims to address the challenge of organizing and tracking daily, monthly, and yearly tasks in a centralized and user-friendly platform. The project's primary goal is to provide users with a seamless experience for inputting, prioritizing, and managing tasks to enhance users' productivity and time management skills.
